                <p>I'm a passionate and curious web development and technology enthusiast. Currently pursuing my BSc in Information Technology, I love building creative projects that blend hardware and software — like smart devices and dynamic websites.

                    My journey started with small projects, and now I’m excited to keep learning and taking on bigger challenges. From leading college tech projects to developing smart prototypes like the Smart Vacuum Cleaner, I enjoy turning ideas into real working solutions.
                    
                    Outside coding and electronics, I enjoy participating in sports like cricket and kho-kho, which help me stay energetic and focused. I believe in continuous learning, teamwork, and pushing my limits every day.</p>

                    <h3>Project Title</h3>
                    <p>I developed a Smart Vacuum Cleaner using Arduino, capable of detecting obstacles and dust. It autonomously navigates and focuses on dirtier areas for efficient cleaning. This project enhanced my skills in embedded systems, sensor integration, and automation.</p>
